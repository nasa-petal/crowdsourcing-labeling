      <p><b>Abstract</b>: Frogs that build foam nests floating on water face the problems of over-dispersion of the secretions used
        and eggs being dangerously exposed at the foam : air interface. nest construction behaviour of tungara frogs,
        engystomops pustulosus, has features that may circumvent these problems. pairs build nests in periodic bursts
        of foam production and egg deposition, three discrete phases being discernible. the first is characterized by
        a bubble raft without egg deposition and an approximately linear increase in duration of mixing events with
        time. this phase may reduce initial over-dispersion of foam precursor materials until a critical concentration
        is achieved. the main building phase is marked by mixing events and start-to-start intervals being nearly
        constant in duration. during the final phase, mixing events do not change in duration but intervals between
        them increase in an exponential-like fashion. pairs joining a colonial nesting abbreviate their initial phase,
        presumably by exploiting a pioneer pair's bubble raft, thereby reducing energy and material expenditure,
        and time exposed to predators. finally, eggs are deposited only in the centre of nests with a continuously
        produced, approximately 1 cm deep egg-free cortex that protectively encloses hatched larvae in stranded nests.

      <b>Abstract</b>: Patterns and rates of air movements in the mounds and nests of macrotermes michaelseni were studied using tracer
        methods. wind is a significant source of energy for powering nest ventilation, despite the mound being a
        completely enclosed structure. nests are ventilated by a tidal movement of air driven by temporal variation
        in wind speed and wind direction. density gradients sufficiently steep to drive bulk flow by natural
        convection will be rare. however, metabolism-induced buoyant forces may interact with wind energy in a way
        that promotes homeostasis of the mound atmosphere
